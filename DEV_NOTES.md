# Dev Notes

Somes notes I keep for the development of the app

```sh
APP_NAME=iep # This will change once I come up with a better name
```

## XDG Variable Reference

Just storing these so I don't have to keep looking them up

```sh
XDG_DATA_HOME = $HOME/.local/share
XDG_STATE_HOME = $HOME/.local/state
XDG_CONFIG_HOME = $HOME/.config
```

## Files

### exercises.db

```sh
${XDG_DATA_HOME}/${APP_NAME}/exercises.db
```
